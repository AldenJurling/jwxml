jwxml
================

*Note: This is probably mostly useful internally at STScI.*

Misc XML support helper code related to some JWST config files, mostly optics and wavefront sensing related. 


So far this provides support for reading in and interacting with: 
  * The so-called SIAF, Science Instrument Aperture Files
  * Wavefront control Segment Update Request files.


More functionality may be added ad hoc as needed; no overall long term development master plan is implied.
